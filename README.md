# Data Science Portfolio
Data science repository of projects completed by me for self learning and academic purposes. Presentend in Jupyter notebooks.

The codes are developed in Python.

_Note: Data used in the projects is for demonstration only._

- ### Machine Learning

	- [Stock Portfolio Recommendation System](https://github.com/fzarpellon/data-science-portfolio/blob/main/Brazilian-Stock-Recommendation-System/Carteira_IBOV.ipynb): Exploratory analysis of companies listed on the IBOV index of the Brazilian stock exchange. Focusing on analyzing company data to create an investment portfolio recommendation system by selecting a machine learning model with the lowest loss over time.
	- [Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://github.com/fzarpellon/data-science-portfolio/blob/main/Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection/credit-card.ipynb): A binary classification model to predict credit card fraud with unbalanced data. Using exploratory data analysis, undersampling and oversampling with synthetic SMOTE, Adasyn and Borderline data to build a model that accurately predicts the credit card fraud.
	- [Data Visualization and real estate market analysis](https://github.com/fzarpellon/data-science-portfolio/blob/main/King-County-Real-State/House_.ipynb): Using statistical, sensitivity and feature selection analysis of a given King County real estate market. Market preferences that significantly influence house prices are identified, generating insights for builders to boost sales and meet the demands of the real state market.
